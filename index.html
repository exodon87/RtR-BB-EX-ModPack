<h4><span style="color: rgb(3, 3, 3); font-weight: bold;">Known Bugs / Issues:&nbsp;</span></h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>camo nettings removal not working</li><li>"tag friendly" not working</li><li>buildable objects with usable ladders cant be removed...</li><li>towed
vehicles position will be reset after a restart when no player has
entered the vehicle after untowing it cause the server isnt updating
the position to the database while towing... (when u enter the car u
have towed once, it updates the position of the car in the database)</li></ul><br><h4>Patch Notes:<br></h4><h4 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">Beta 0.1</h4><ul><li>first Release... kind of "Open Beta Test"&nbsp;<br></li></ul><h4 style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Beta 0.2</h4><ul><li>replaced some 1.0.1.4 epoch code with the missed 1.0.1.5 code (workbench and other things are now working...)</li><li>fixed
a critical bug wich causes objects to reappear after server restarts,
or they didnt disappeared after "removing" so the player was able to
exploit unlimited materials</li><li>fixed a bug in the "edit code"
function for infopanels wich were sometimes creating a duplicate with
the new key... now it completly removes the old panel and build a new
one at the same position with the entered code (also when players run
around or whatever...)</li><li>fixed a bug in the way how the placed
objects are placed after the restart wich has fixed the shifting on the
most objects (not always!) and also it fixed the issue why zombies
could run through some objects like containers, sandbags....</li><li>updated
basebuilding code so it should work without the "deployable" table in
the database, thats why i also removed the main sql file from the
package... CleanupActions.sql is still available....</li><li>fixed many other small bugs...</li></ul><br><h4><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(2, 2, 2);">Important Notes:</span><br></h4><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
If u want to remove some plugins i have added, u should bring some
knowledge in arma 2 scripting... cause i dont have that much time to
write a tutorial how to activate each single function /
plugin...&nbsp; I'm already working on a "standalone" version of my
base building... but i had to modify a lot of files to get this finally
working without critical bugs and thats why i need much more time to
create a understandable "How To" cause otherwise u could create a lot
of critical bugs when u just try to copy my files out of the mission
into yours... there are a lot of serverside overrides to the epoch main
system wich i had to create to make both system work
together....&nbsp; AND i can only give support to the modifications
i have made... i cannot answer questions wich belong to the main coders
versions / contents...<br></div><h4><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(1, 1, 1);"><br><br>Package Content:<br></span></h4><ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>dayz_server.pbo</li><li><span style="color: rgb(3, 3, 3);">dayz_11.epoch.chernarus.pbo</span> (you
maybe have to rename this... depends on wich instance u are using for
your epoch... but this is the default name fromthe epoch release...)</li><li><span style="color: rgb(1, 1, 1);">Battleye Filters</span>&nbsp; (some modified filters, u wont
get any kicks with these but maybe there is some risk to give hacker
some ways to execute their scripts... but on my server the hackers
always getting kicked cause they use too many scripts... some of them
will activate the "ban-hammer" and also depends on wich other "anti
hack" plugins u are using... i always recommend to use something like
"AntiHax" or "Gotcha" but for those i cant give u any working files /
filters...i think with your server rpt log and the other log files from
your plugin you will be able to easily modify the filters of your "extra anti hack" to your needs
to be able to play this mission without any kicks / bans...)<br></li></ul>



<h4><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(6, 6, 6);"><br>How To Use / Install:</span></h4><h6>(when u already have some experience with arma servers than u know what
you have to do)
&nbsp;</h6><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><ul><li>Download and&nbsp; unpack&nbsp; the .rar file
somewhere...<br><br></li><li>After unpacking the rar file open the folder&nbsp;
"RtR-Epoch-M-BB-Chernarus-MiniPack_0-1-beta",&nbsp; u should have a
Battleye folder, a readme file, two .pbo files and two .sql files....<br><br></li><li>Copy the&nbsp; "dayz_server.pbo"&nbsp;
and&nbsp; replace&nbsp; your old one with this... (should be
stored in&nbsp; "...\@Dayz_Epoch_Server\addons\"&nbsp; )<br><br></li><li>Copy the&nbsp; "dayz_11.epoch.chernarus.pbo"&nbsp;
and&nbsp; replace&nbsp; your old one with this (maybe u have to
rename this file... depends on how your old file is called... but only
chernarus is working with this one!!)
4.1 (Optional) If u want to edit the start loadout or some other epoch
configurations then u have to unpack the mission pbo and edit the
init.sqf, it already has the required code inside cause this package
comes with a map in the loadout) but only do this if u really know what
u are doing... i wont give support on modified packages... sorry but my
time is not endless ^^ )<br><br></li><li>Open the&nbsp; Battleye&nbsp; folder and
copy&nbsp; all the contents&nbsp; and&nbsp;
replace&nbsp; your old filters with this one... (server battleye
folder should be in the same folder&nbsp; where your server config
file is stored&nbsp; in...)<br><br></li><li>Optional,
if u want your database to clean up
destroyed cars, dead bodies and filling up empty traders stock
than&nbsp;import the "CleanupActions.sql" file using phpMyAdmin or some
software like Navicat or
HeidiSQL.<br><br></li><li>Start your Server and when u have done everything right u
can have fun</li></ul></div><p></p>













<h4><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(2, 2, 2);">Last Words:<br></span></h4><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
I hope i havent forget any credits or something else... and btw... sry
if some words are written wrong or when u dont understand something
directly but my english is not the best ^^ i know that ^^ but i'm fine
with that xD and when u find any bugs or exploits pls tell me so i can
take a look into it... i already tested (together with some creativ
players) nearly everything wich is possible to exploit or wich could
cause bugs... only bugs are already in the "know issues" section... ^^
when u find something else the list will grow... but i hope it wont...
cause i'm kind of a "Coding Noob" and it take a lot of time for me to
fix bugs xD
And if u want some more stuff in this package or if u may have a
solution for the known issues, then dont hesitate to contact me...</div><p></p>
